        <p className="mt-6 text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#6B4E34]">
          Bheli Foods began with a simple, heartfelt dream — to bring back the pure, homely taste of Bharat into every modern kitchen. We saw children growing up on chocolates and sugary candies, and we asked: why not give them something tastier, healthier, more rooted in our culture? That’s where our <span className="font-semibold text-[#B08946]">Sugar-Free Gud ke Laddu</span> was born.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#6B4E34]">
          Our founder, <span className="font-semibold">Sanket Singh</span>, started Bheli Foods with the purpose of replacing harmful refined sugar with natural jaggery — handpicked, pure, and chemical-free. Our recipes are traditional, but our hygiene standards are modern. Every laddu is crafted with care, rich in iron and minerals, and packed with natural sweetness.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#6B4E34]">
          From a small kitchen in Uttar Pradesh to a brand with a global vision — our journey is about trust, purity, and the real taste of Bharat.
